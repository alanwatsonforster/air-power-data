\subsection{Boeing CH-47 Chinook}

The Boeing CH-47 is a twin-rotor, heavy-lift transport helicopter.

Although the CH-47 has evolved and adapted more modern technologies over its long life, the CH-47A/B/C/D/F/J and HC.1/2/4/5/6 versions have similar capabilities in game terms and are not distinguished in the Helicopter Data Table. Later models, often upgraded in service, have improved infrared countermeasures. The M24 and M41 armament subsystems mount 7.62 mm M60 or M240 machine guns on the side (M24) and rear doors (M41).

The ACH-47 “Guns-a-Go-Go” gunship has additional armor and the M34 armament subsystem providing two fixed 20 mm M24 cannon, and provision for two M159 \binarymultiply{19}{70 mm} RPs. It also had .50 cal M2 door guns provided by the M32 and M33 armament subsystems.

The MH-47 versions are adapted for special-forces operations. The MH-47D has air-to-air refueling, forward-looking infrared, and the side M60s are replaced by M134 miniguns, the HH-47E adds terrain-following radar, and the MH-47G is armed with two 7.62 mm M134 miniguns and two 7.62 mm M240 machine guns on the side doors.

The CH-47 entered service with the US Army in 1966 and served in the Vietnam War and many conflicts since then. It also serves or has served with many US allies, including the RAF. Four ACH-47s were tested by the USAF in Vietnam in 1966. The MH-47D entered service in 1984, the MH-47E in 1991 and the MH-47F in 2006.
