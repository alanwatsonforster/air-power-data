\subsection{Hughes OH-6 Cayuse}

The Hughes OH-6 is a scout and light attack helicopter. Although formally named the “Cayuse", it was more commonly known as the “Loach,” with this nickname being derived from the {\itshape Light Observation Helicopter} program under which it was developed.It is small, maneuverable, and robust. 

While normally unarmed, the OH-6A can be fitted with the M27 armament subsystem that mounts a 7.62 mm M134 minigun on the right side of the fuselage and provides it with 2000 rounds of ammunition. The mount can elevate and depress, but not traverse.

The OH-6A version served in large numbers with the US Army in the Vietnam War, entering service in 1966 and serving until being replaced by the OH-58 towards the end of the war.
