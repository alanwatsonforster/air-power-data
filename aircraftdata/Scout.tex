\subsection{Westland Scout}

The Westland Scout AH.1 is a scout, utility, and light attack helicopter developed for the British Army. The similar Wasp was simultaneously developed for the Royal Navy.

It can be armed with a 7.62 mm GPMG door gun, either on the left of the right, with 200 rounds and four SS.11 RGs. Alternatively, it can carry two fixed 7.62 mm GPMG guns, again each with 200 rounds.

The Scout served with the British Army from 1963 to about 1994 and with the Royal Marines from 1971 to 1982. It saw combat in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Aden Emergency, Oman, Northern Ireland, and the South Atlantic War.
