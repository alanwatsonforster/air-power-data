The Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet is a two-seat advanced trainer and light attack aircraft. It was developed starting in 1967 and entered service in 1979.

\subsection{Versions}

\subsubsection{Alpha Jet E}

The Alpha Jet E was the trainer version, with the E designation taken from \emph{École} (school). It was equipped with two underwing and one centerline weapon stations, but in French and Belgian service these were intended only for weapons training. Some of its later users employed it as a light strike aircraft, despite its shortcomings compared to aircraft dedicated to this role.

It initially served in the French Armée de l’air and the Belgian Air Force, but later with the air forces of Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Qatar, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, and with private companies.

\subsubsection{Alpha Jet A}

The Alpha Jet A was the attack version, with the A designation taken from \emph{Appui Tactique} (tactical support). Compared to the E version, the A version had two additional underwing weapon stations, a more advanced weapon system, and could replace the rear crew member with an ECM suite.

It initially served in the German Luftwaffe, but after the end of the Cold War many of these aircraft were sold to the air forces of Portugal and Thailand.

\subsection{Armament and Stores}

The Alpha Jet has no internal guns, but when armed would typically carry a gun pod on the centerline station, normally a
CC420 30 mm DEFA pod for E models or a 27 mm Mauser pod for A models. The gun pod was originally not jettisonable, but this restriction was lifted by the 1989 upgrade of Luftwaffe Alpha Jet As.

Typical stores would be SNEB 68~mm or CRV7 70~mm RPs or HE or cluster bombs.

\subsection{Combat}

The Alpha Jet E saw combat in both Moroccan and Nigerian service, in the former case against Polisario Front in the Western Sahara War and in the latter against the Boko Haram militant group.
