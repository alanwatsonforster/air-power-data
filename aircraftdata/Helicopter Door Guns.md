# Helicopter Door Guns

## M60D

- 550-650 RPM

- 200 round box at 600 RPM = 10 shots

- M60D with 750 round box at 600 RPM = 35 shots

Assume CSAR and SO helicopters have the M60D (750 round) version and others have the M60 (200 round) version.

## GPMG

- 650-1000 RPM

- 200 round box at 1000 RPM = 6 shots, but this disadvantages the GPMG compared to the M60. Both have the same effectiveness, but the GPMP would have fewer shots. It is probably better to assume a 600 RPM rate.

## M134

- 3000 RPM
- 3000 rounds = 30 units

## .50 cal M2

- 450–600 RPM for M2HB

- 200 round box at 500 RPM = 12 shots
