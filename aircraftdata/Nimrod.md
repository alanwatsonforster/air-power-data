- Cruise speed 490 mph
- Ceiling; 44 kft

Goebel:

- Max speed at altitude 580 mph
- Cruise speed: 545 mph
- Patrol speed: 230 mph
- Ceiling: 42 kft

### Load

full fuel and full load = 106
1/3 fuel and full load = 48
1/3 = 28

- Searchwater: <https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-1-6432-7072-2/chapter/bk978-1-6432-7072-2ch6>

## DDS

Goebel says they were upgraded with underwing CH/FL dispensers.

Wikipedia says Nimrod MR.2s in the Gulf War in 1990 were fitted with towed arrays. R1s in 1990 were fitted with these and with underwing CH/FL dispensers reportedly from Tornados.

### Fuel

- Wikipedia: 85840 lb = 4300 fuel points

- Endurance is 10 hours (Wikipedia) = 1.4 fuel points/turn

- On patrol could shut down outer engines. Assume N consumption is 3 with 4 engines and 1.5 with two engines.
- Assume restarting engines takes 3 minutes = 15 game turns.
