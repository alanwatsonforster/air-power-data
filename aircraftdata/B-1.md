# B-1

## ADCs

- [B-1B](B-1B.json)

Adapted from Puma.

### Size

- Il-28 (8):
- B-29 (10): 99 x 141 ft
- Tu-16 (10): 114 x 108 ft
- Tu-22M (11): 139 x 76/112 ft
- B-1 (11): 151 x 78/137 ft
- B-52 (12): 159 x 185 ft
- B-36 (13): 162 x 230 ft

### Vulnerability

Puma has -1, but the aircraft is large and strengthed for nuclear shock waves. I think +1 is more appropriate.

## B-1A Stores

No moveable bulkhead. No external stations.

## B-1B Stores

- MPRL
  - 8 AGM-69A SRAM (1985-1990)
  - 8 B61/B83 (1985-1997)
  - 8 Mk 84 BB or GBU-31(V)1/B or GBU-31(V)3/B JDAM (from 1998)
  - 8 x AGM-154A tested but not deployed (from 2003)
  - 8 x AGM-158A JASSM (from 2005)
  - 8 x AGM-158B JASSM-ER (from 2014)
  - 8 x AGM-158C LRASM (from 2018)
  - MER upgraded: two GBU-38/54 in place of GBU-31 (from 2022)

- CBM:
  - 28 x Mk 82 BB (high- or low-drag) or Mk 36/62 mines (from 1985)
  - 10 x CBU-87/89/97 (ECBM from 1996)
  - 6 x CBU-103/104/105 (SECBM from 2005)
  - 6 x GBU-38 (SECBM from 2005)
  - Only 5 x GBU-54 <https://www.military.com/defensetech/2017/12/21/whats-b-1b-lancer-aircrews-wish-list-room-more-bombs.html>

- CSRL
  - 8 x AGM-86A ALCM (tested but never deployed)
  - 8 x AGM-129A ACM (tested but never deployed)

- FT = 2,975 gal (11,262 L)
- Small FT
  - Intermediate bay extended from 15 to 22 feet
  - Forward bay reduced from 15 to 8 feet
  - Assume capacity halved = 5600L

- External pylons:
  - Not suitable to carry AGM-86A ALCM
  - 14 x AGM-129 ACM (tested but never deployed)
  - 1000 gal FTs (planned but not deployed)
  - Decommissioned to satisfy New START, so they must have been nuclear-capable. Perhaps this referred to the ALCM and ACM?
  - AAQ-33 Sniper pod from 2008. Allowed use of GBU-54.

Mixed conventional loads from 2005.

### B-1R Performnce

- B-1B engines are 17,390 lbf dry and 30,780 lbf with afterburner
- B-1R propoed to have Pratt & Whitney F119 with 26,000 lbf dry (50% more) and >35,000 lbf (20% more) with afterburner

### New Pylons

- <https://theaviationist.com/2025/07/10/boeing-contract-b-1b-load-adaptable-modular-pylons/>

Can each carry 2 x 2000 lb or 1 x 5000 lb weapon

### B-1 Load

1/3 internal fuel = 3200 = 64 load points
24 x SRAM/B61 = 24,000 lb = 24 load points = 88 for 1/2

### B-1R

- Radar
- DDR
- Roll HFPs
- Loads
- AMRAAMs
- VPs
- Stealth

## B-1A Speed

Mach 2.2 at altitude
Mach 0.85 at low level = 6.5

Test program reached:

- Mach 1.6 at 50,0000 ft
- Mach 1.6 at 40,0000 ft
- Mach 1.9 at 43,0000 ft =
- Mach 2.12 at 50,000 ft = 13.8 at VH
- Mach 2.2 at unspecified altitude = 14.3 at VH+
- Mach 0.85 at 500 ft = 6.5

## B-1B Speed

Mach 0.92 at low altitude = 705 mph
Mach 1.2 at altitude = 780 mph

Sweep wings at?

- 5.5? Onset of LTD at high altitude
- 6.5? Onset of LTD at low altitude
- 6.5? Katz mentions TFF at Mach 0.85 with full sweep
- 5.0? Onset of compressibility for aircraft.
