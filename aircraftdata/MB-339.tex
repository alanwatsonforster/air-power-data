The Aermacchi MB-339 is a trainer and light-attack aircraft. It was developed from the MB-326.

\subsection{Versions}

\subsubsection{MB-339A}

The MB-339A was developed from the MB-326K. It gained a new forward fuselage for two crew, with the rear one being elevated to give better visibility, a new tail, and deleted the internal guns. It kept the wing and the 4,000 lbf Viper 632-43 engine. The additional weight of the fuselage modifications reduced the stores capacity to 3,500~lb.

The MB-339A was used by the Italian AMI (one hundred and seven), the Argentine COAN (ten MB-339AA), the Ghanaian Air Force (four), the Malaysian RMAF (thirteen MB-339AN), the Peruvian Air Force (sixteen MB-339AP), and the Nigerian Air Force (twelve MB-339AN), and the UAE Air Force (seventeen).

\subsubsection{MB-339C and MB-339CD}

The MB-339C is largely similar to the A, but has updated flight controls and avionics, including a RWR. The CD version also has a

The MB-339C serves with the Italian AMI (thirty MB-33CD), the Eritrean Air Force (six MB-339CE), and the Malaysian RMAF (MB-339CM).

\subsubsection{MB-339CB}

The MB-339CB is largely similar to the C, but uses the more powerful 4,440~lbf Viper 680-43 engine.

The MB-339CB served with the RNZAF from 1991 to 2003 and then with the French AA from 2019 for DACT.

\subsection{Armament and Stores}

The MB-339 can be armed with gun pods (including ones with a 30~mm DEFA cannon and .50~cal machine guns), rocket pods, bombs, and is wired for AIM-9 Sidewinder and Matra R.550 Magic IRMs. It can use 330L FTs.

In Argentine COAN service, it was typically armed with two gun pods each with a 30~mm DEFA cannon and 120 rounds per gun and then either two LAU-10 RP (each with four Zuni rockets), two Matra-155 RPs (each with twelve 68~mm rockets), or two Mk~81 or Mk~82 BBs. The LAU-10 RPs were favored in the South Atlantic War.

\subsection{Combat}

Argentine COAN MB-339As saw combat in the 1982 South Atlantic War, flying out of BAM Malvinas (Port Stanley Airport). They were used for armed reconnaissance and close air support. Of the seven deployed to the Islands, one crashed in poor weather, one was shot down by a Blowpipe, two were destroyed on the ground by naval gunfire, one was unable to escape, and two escaped back to the mainland.

Eritrean MB-339Cs saw combat in the 1998-2000 Eritrean–Ethiopian War.
