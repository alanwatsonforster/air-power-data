\subsection{Sikorsky CH-3/HH-3}

The Sikorsky CH-3/HH-3 is a medium transport and SAR helicopter. It was developed from the SH-3 Sea King, and one significant change was the addition of a rear ramp. It was known as the “Jolly Green Giant”.

The CH-3C is the initial version and entered service in the USAF in 1964. The CH-3E has more powerful motors. The HH-3E is a conversion of the CH-3E with protective armor, self-sealing fuel tanks, an inflight refueling probe, a high-speed hoist, and other equipment for their SAR role.

The HH-3E is armed with three 7.62 mm M60 door guns, firing to the left, right, and rear. These can also be fitted to the CH-3E.

The CH-3/HH-3 served in the USAF for special operations and SAR, notably during the Vietnam War. The HH-3 was later replaced by the HH-53.
