# UH-1


% Fuselage is 39 ft long

## Armament

For the door gun ammunition, I assume the standard 200 round box for the M60 at 600 rpm giving 10 units. 

For armament options, see:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._helicopter_armament_subsystems#UH-1_Iroquois
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding-Fin_Aerial_Rocket#US_Army_launchers

The M6/M16 option assumes an M60D with 750 round boxes and has 35 units.

The M21 option has 3000 rounds at 3000 RPM and has 30 units.
