# F-94 Starfire

## Versions and Variants

### F-94A

- [ADC](F-94A.json)

Original ADC from APJ 50.

### F-94B

- [ADC](F-94B.json)

Original ADC from APJ 50.

### F-94C

- No ADC.

## Changes to ADC

### SPBR

The SPBR values in the APJ #50 ADC are 2/2/2. Comparing to other similar aircraft, especially the F-80, they should probably be 1/1/1. It is notable that the Meteor ADC in the APJ 50 also has its SPBR values higher than expected by a factor of 2; I suspect they were converted at 4 DP = 1 FP rather than 2 DP = 1 FP. See #277.

### Bombs

The ADC suggests that the F-94A/B can carry bombs on mid-wing stations. I can find no evidence for this. In particular, the SACs for the F-94A/B state that their maximum bomb capacity is 2 bombs, regardless of weight. I would suggest these bombs are being carried on the wing-tip stations. I can find no photos of the F-94A/B carrying bombs.

The Flight Operating Instructions for the F-94B (USAF) state in several places that the bomb controls are disabled.

I have removed bombs from the F-94A/B in [51921f3](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/51921f33af64bf5b9d16b324a00f47306bc56a20).

### Gun Pods

[This photo](http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Upcoming/Photos/igphoto/2000544223/) shows an F-94B with two twin gun pods.

### Fuel

The SAC for the F-94A/B show that they are at MTO weight when the 165/230 gal wing-tip tanks are full. Thus, if bombs are carried in addition to FTs (see above), any weight for bombs must come by reducing fuel. Assuming 6.5 lb/gal and 20 lb per fuel point:

- 1000 lb bomb = 153 gal = reduction of 50 fuel points
- 750 lb bomb = 115 gal = reduction of 38 fuel points
- 500 lb bomb = 80 gal = reduction of 25 fuel points

The ADC states that the 230 gal FT has 74 fuel points.
