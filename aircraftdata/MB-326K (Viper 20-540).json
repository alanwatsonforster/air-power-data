    "description": "The Aermacchi MB-326K is a light attack aircraft. It is derived from the MB-326G, but dispenses with the second crew member, has two internal DEFA 30 mm cannon, and the ability to carry IRMs. This variant has the older and less powerful Viper 20-540 engine. In SAAF service it was known as the Impala Mk II and in Brazilian service as the AT-26A Xavante.",
