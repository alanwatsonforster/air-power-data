# F9F Panther

## Variants

### F9F-2

- [ADC](F9F-2.json)

ADC from TSOH.

### F9F-2B

- [ADC](F9F-2B.json)

ADC from TSOH.

Early versions of the -2 and -3 could only carry three HVARs on each wing (McKelvey Cleaver, ch. 5).

The ADC refers to early and late version of the F9F-2, but the late version seems to be the F9F-2B (Wikipedia). All -2 aircraft were converted to the -2B standard and then commonly referred to as -2 aircraft again (Wikipedia).

Later versions of the -2 could carry six HVARs, six 250 lb bombs, or four 500 lb bombs in the outer wing stations and two 1000 lb bombs on the inner wing stations (SAC). However, they typically launched with a load of 1000-1200 lb (Thompson).

### F9F-2P

- [ADC](F9F-2P.json)

ADC from TSOH.

### F9F-5

- [ADC](F9F-5.json)

ADC from TSOH.

### F9F-5P
