## Notes and Changes

### Stations and Loads

The F-104A/B only had the wing-tip stations (for IRMs and FTs) and wing stations (for FTs) (Goebel). The F-104C/D added the centerline station for a MDR or B28 nuclear weapon, but not FTs (Goebel).

According to the 1968 operating manual:

A and B can carry:
- Wing-tip AIM-9B
- Pylon tanks
- Tip tanks

The C can carry
- M117A on fuselage or wing pylons
- MA-2 rocker launchers on wing pylons
- LAU-3/A rocket pods on wing pylons
- M117A, M116-A2, BLU-1/B, BLU-27/B (finned or unfinned) on wing pylons
- AIM-9B on fuselage launcher

The D can carry:
- LAU-3/A, MA-2 rocket launchers, M-117 bombs, M116-A2 napalm bombs, Mk-83 bomb, LAU-10/A rocket pod, BLU-1/B, BLU-27/B (finned or unfinned), BLU-32/B on wing pylon

I'm not sure what the MA-2 is; it might be a practice rocket launcher.
