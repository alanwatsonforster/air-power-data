# F7U Cutlass

## Variants and Versions

### F7U-3

- [ADC](F7U-3.json)

ADC from TSOH.

### F7U-3M

- [ADC](F7U-3M.json)

ADC from TSOH.

## Notes and Changes

### Radar

According to the SACs, the -3 has an APG-30 ranging radar and only the -3M has an APQ-51 radar. (On the other hand, it states that the -3 can carry up to four Sparrow-I missiles.) Changed in [c71085f](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c71085f636825e745482870bf76ebeabc33eb3db).

### Pod

The TSOH ADC does not give the weight of the pod. 

The SAC of the -3M states that the ventral pod carries 220 gal (830L) or 32 2.75-inch rockets. 

At 6.5 lb per gallon and 20 lb per fuel point, this is about 70 fuel points. The similar pod for the Meteor F.8 has a weight of 1500 and 3.0/2.0 load points. 

The 70 mm rockets in the LAU-3A pod weight about 25 lb each, including the pod. A pod with 32 rockets would weight about 800 lb. A 450L FT also weights 800 lb and contributes 2.5/1.5 load points. Reducing this by 0.5 for being conformal (and in line with the Meteor tank), it would be 2.0/1.0 load points.

I have added these characteristics in [0e3d237](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/0e3d23761cc26866ac94884fce1be07806c8ee48).

It is not clear if the tank is can be jettisoned in flight.

### Nuclear Weapons

Thompson relates that the F7U was equipped with a nuclear weapon (perhaps a Mark 12?) and LABS.

### Issues

- Confirm the gun is M3 or Mk 12
- Does the -3 have APQ-51?
- Can the pod be jettisoned?
- Can the -3 somehow fire Sparrows with just the APG-30?
- Extra fuel for the -3M.

## Operational History

Introduced in January 1953.
