## ADCs

## Notes and Changes

## Vampire F.1

- Unclipped wings (Watkins)
- 202 Imp gal fuel (Watkins)
- 50 and 100 imp gal FTs (Goebel)
- Limited to 20,000 ft by the canopy pressure seal (Watkins)
- First 40 had Goblin 1 and later aircraft had Goblin 2 (Watkins)
- First 50 did not have cockpit pressurization (Watkins)
- Swedish F.1 had Goblin 2.

- Used by UK (RAF), France (AA), and Dominican Republic (AMD/FARD) (Watkins)

- ADC
  - Ignore the early versions without pressurization and with the Goblin 1
  - Use F.3 ADC
  - Reduce fuel 202 gal for F1 compared to 330 gal for F.3 means 200 * 202 / 330 = 122 fuel points.

### Vampire F.3

- Goblin 2 and unclipped wings.
- Goblin 2 (BAE, Watkins)
- Internal fuel 399 US gal = 130 fuel points (Goebel)
- Internal fuel 330 Imp gal = 390 US gallons (Watkins)
- Total fuel 530 Imp gal (Watkins) implies two 100 gal FTs
- External fuel tanks 455L or 909L (Goebel)
- External FTs 100/200 Imp gal (Watkins) = 450/900L
- No ejection seat (Goebel)

- Used by RAF, RCAF, Norway (Wikipedia)
- Used by UK (RAF), Canada (RCAF), Sweden (Flygvapnet), and Mexico (FAM) (Watkins)

### Vampire FB.5

- Goblin 2 and clipped wings (Goebel, Wikipedia, Watkins)
- Armored protection around engine systems (Goebel, Watkins)
- No ejection seat (Goebel/Watkins)
- 100 imp gal FT (Watkins)

- Used by RAF, SAAF, Venezuela (Goebel)
- Used by UK (RAF), France (AA), Italy (AMI), Lebanon (LAF), New Zealand (RNZAF), South Africa (SAAF),

### SNCASE FB.5

- License-built
- 1950
- 67 examples

### Vampire FB.6

- FB.5 with Goblin 3 (Goebel/Watkins)
- Goblin 3 (BAE)
- Built by de Havilland and under license by Emmen
- Used by Switzerland (Goebel/Watkins)

### FB.6 (late)

- Ejection seats added in 1960 (Watkins)

### Vampire FB.9

- FB.5 but with air conditioning (Goebel/Watkins) and new canopy to prevent misting (Watkins).
- No ejection seat (Goebel)
- Goblin 2 (Watkins)
- Version for Rhodesia had Goblin 3 (Goebel/Watkins)

### Vampire NF.10

- AI Mk 10 radar from Mosquito (Watkins)
- IFF (Wilkines)
- Standard 20 mm armament (Watkins)
- Two crew (Watkins)
- Goblin 3 engine to compensate for the increased weight of the radar equipment (Watkins)
- Wings of the FB.5 (Watkins)
- Fuel = 330 gal internal + two external 100 gal tanks (Watkins)
- Originally intended for Egypt, but order taken over by RAF (Watkins)
- No ejection seats (Watkins)
- Bombing capacity retained (Watkins), but presumably not the rocket rails?
- In service with RAF in 1951.

I will give it the same performance as the FB.5, on the supposition that the performance gains of the Goblin 3 are largely compensated by the additional weight.

I take the performance of the AI Mk X from Chris Perleberg's ADC for the Meteor NF.11 (on the ADC for the Meteor F.8).

### Vampire T.11

- Same armament as FB-5 (Watkins)
- Refitted with ejection seats from 1954 (Watkins)

### Sea Vampire F.20

- FB.5 with arrestor hook, strengthened undercarriage (Watkins).
- I'm not sure why it is the F.20 and not the FB.20.
- Performed both catpult take-offs and arrested landings (Watkins).
- More effective speed brakes (Watkins).

### Sea Vampire F.21

- Used for flexible deck experiments
- Strengthened undersurfaces

### Sea Vampire T.22

- Derived from T.11 and not carrier-capable (Watkins).
- Refitted with ejector seats between April 1956 and May 1957 (Watkins).

### DHA Vampire F.30

- First flew June 1949 and delivered to RAAF in September 1949 (Watkins).
- "Elephant's ears" intakes moved to underside of fuselage to improve the handling (Watkins).
- Ceiling 49kft and maximum speed 570 mph at SL, approximately 50 mph faster
  than the Goblin versions and similar to the Mistral (Watkins)

- I presume this is more like an F.3 in terms of stores.
- I will adopt the performance of the Mistral

### DHA Vampire FB.31

- Nene 2-VH engine (Watkins)
- Clipped and strengthened wings (Watkins)

- Goblin 2 engine (Watkins, ch. 5)
Watkins, ch. 3:

> From 1943 until September 1945, fifty Goblin 1 engines were produced by the de Havilland (Engines) Company. They were followed on the production line by the Goblin 2 which was first delivered in October 1945. Between this date and March 1953, a total of 3,606 Goblin 2 engines were built for the Vampire F 3, FB 5, FB 9, FB 52A and the Sea Vampire F 20. The final production Goblin engines, the Goblin 3 for the Vampire FB 6, NF 10, T 11, FB 50 and FB 52, and the Goblin 35 for the Vampire NF 54 and T 55, were built from October 1948. When production ceased in 1955, a total of 2,688 Goblin 3/35 engines had been built.

Watkins, ch. 7:

> A variation of the Vampire FB 52 was the FB 52A built for the Italian Air Force; fifty-one were supplied from Chester between July 1950 and December 1951, followed by at least a further twenty-seven built by the Aeronautica Macchi and FIAT factories.

Watkins, ch. 35:

> As it would be at least twelve months before Italian production lines could begin delivering substantial quantities of Vampires to the AMI, an order for fifty-one FB 52As procured from de Havilland ensured that units could become operational much sooner. The aircraft were supplied from Chester between July 1950 and December 1951, together with a further ten which were probably dispatched as component sets to FIAT and serialled S3-156 to S3-166, S3-171 to S3-240 (within the range MM6005 to MM6019 and MM6024 to MM6059).

> By this time, production of the licence-built Vampires in Italy was well under way with FIAT constructing ninety-three at their Turin plant and Maachi assembling a further twenty-seven at Varese. These airframes were designated FB 52As and the serial range for this first block was in the range MM6023 to MM6142. The first Vampire to come off the production lines flew on 18 December 1951 from Venegono, piloted by Maachi’s chief test pilot Guido Carestiato. It was followed on 22 December by FIAT’s first Vampire, flown by Simeone Marsan at Turin/Caselle.

> The second block of thirty licence-built Vampires were serialled MM6155 to MM6184 with Macchi and FIAT producing seventeen and thirteen aircraft respectively. When the British Government placed an embargo on military exports to Egypt, fifty-eight ex-AMI Vampires were refurbished by Maachi and in March 1956, forty-three of these aircraft were flown via Brindisi-Athens-Cairo with the remaining fifteen airframes shipped in crates. To replace those dispatched to Egypt, Maachi built a further forty-five new aircraft. Various British Foreign Office statements reported the purchase of thirteen Italian-built Vampires by Egypt in March 1955, together with a further eighteen during October. This last order was routed via Syria, which retained some aircraft to join the thirteen Vampires originally delivered to them in 1954.

- Used by Italy and then sold to Egypt (Wikipedia).
- 45 former Italian AF reconditioned and delivered to Egypt in 1954 (Watkins)
- 13 former Italian AF reconditioned and delivered to Syria in 1954 (Watkins)
- 7 former Egyptian AF delivered to Jordan in 1956
- 13 former Egyptian AF delivered to Saudi Arabia in 1957

### Vampire NF.54

- Export version of NF.10.
- India (39) and Italy (14) (Watkins)
- Indian NF.54 were refurbished ex-RAF aircraft (Watkins)

### J28A

- Swedish version of F Mk I (Wikins).

Used by: Sweden, Austria, and Dominican Republic

### Vampire T.55

- T.11 early without and late with ejection seats (Watkins)

### Vampire PR.55

- T.55 adapted with cameras for photo-reconnaissance (Watkins)
- First entered service in 1954 (Watkins)
- Served in 1965 war (Watkins)
- Not clear if it retained its gun armament

### Engines

Watkins, ch. 3:

> From 1943 until September 1945, fifty Goblin 1 engines were produced by the de Havilland (Engines) Company. They were followed on the production line by the Goblin 2 which was first delivered in October 1945. Between this date and March 1953, a total of 3,606 Goblin 2 engines were built for the Vampire F 3, FB 5, FB 9, FB 52A and the Sea Vampire F 20. The final production Goblin engines, the Goblin 3 for the Vampire FB 6, NF 10, T 11, FB 50 and FB 52, and the Goblin 35 for the Vampire NF 54 and T 55, were built from October 1948. When production ceased in 1955, a total of 2,688 Goblin 3/35 engines had been built.

Ibid:

> The Goblin engine was also built under licence by Societa per Anzioni FIAT of Turin, Italy, and Svenska Flygmotor at Trollhatten in Sweden. The Goblin 2 engines produced for the Swedish J28A Vampires were designated as RM 1s whereas the later J28Bs and J28Cs had Swedish-built RM 1As (Goblin 3s). The Swedish-built engines were adapted with roller bearings in the engine in place of the standard ball bearings fitted by de Havilland.

- Goblin 2:
  - 3,100 lbf
  - F.3
  - FB.5/9/51 (Goebel)
  - Later Mk 1s (Wikipedia, Watkins)
  - Perleberg's ADC has the F.3 with reduced maximum speeds and climb rates; I will presume these apply to the Goblin 2 version. The F.3 also has unclipped wing tips, which might reduce the speed at low altitude, but I can't see how they would reduce the rate of climb.
- Goblin 3:
  - 3,350 lbf
  - 8% more thrust than the Goblin 2
  - FB.6/50/52/52A and FB.5 for Rhodesia (Goebel)
  - Watkins at one point says the 52A has the Goblin 2, but at another states that it has a Goblin 3 engine.
  - All from F.3 onwards (Wikipedia)
  - Perleberg's ADC has the F.5/9 with better maximum speeds and climb rates; I will presume these apply to the Goblin 3 version.
- Nene 102
  - 5,000 lb
  - Mk 53 (de Havilland) or SE.530 Mistral (Sud-Est)

### Ejection Seats

- No RAF Vampires had ejection seats (Goebel).
- Installed on Swiss FB.6 in 1960 (Watkins).
- Installed on T.11 from March 1954 to December 1957.

### Weapon Stations

Perleberg's ADC (and presumably the original Desert Falcons ADC) has the wrong weapon stations.

There are two outer wing stations that can carry FT and BB and four inner wing stations that can each carry two RP-3 RKs (Gobel; see also the photo of the FB.5 in Wikipedia).

### Visibility

Poor rear visibility from armor behind pilot's seat (Watkins, ch. 1)

### Combat

- RAF in Aden and Malaya (Watkins)
- Algeria, Burma, Dominican Republic, Egypt, India, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Rhodesia, and Venezuela (Watkins)
