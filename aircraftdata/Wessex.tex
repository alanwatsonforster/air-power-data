\subsection{Westland Wessex}

The Westland Wessex is a medium anti-submarine, transport, and utility helicopter. It is a licensed version of the Sikorsky S-58 with the radial piston engine replaced by one or two tuboshaft engines.

The HAS.1 and HAS.3 versions are anti-submarine versions. They can be equipped with either a dipping sonar or with torpedos or depth charges, so tend to operate in hunter-killer pairs. The Wessex 31A/B are similar to the HAS.1/3. The HC.2 and HU.5 are transport versions. 

The HAS.1/HAS.3/HU.5 served in the RN from 1961 until about 1990. The HC.2 served in the RAF from 1962 to 2022. The HAS.1 and HC2 served in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. The HAS.3 and HU.5 saw combat in the South Atlantic War.

The Wessex 31A/B served in the RAN in the anti-submarine role 1963 to 1980 and then as a transport and utility helicopter until 1989.
