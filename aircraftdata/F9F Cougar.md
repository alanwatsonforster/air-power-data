## Notes and Changes

### Guns

TSOH states these are Mk. 12, but they are elsewhere noted as M3 (SAC for -8B/-8T Wikipedia has them as M3. Changed to M3 in [6c85305](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/6c85305ca812ca8ceeb81827026fdf5ccd997736).

The SACs stated that 760 rounds are carried (except for the -8T which has 260). At the 720 RPM of the M3, this is an ammunition of 8.0. However, the TSOH ADC has 6.0, which would be appropriate for four Mk. 12 firing at 1000 RPM. I have changed the ammunition to 8.0 in [87806cc](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/87806cc394e57354bd1140a79e31f1f04a9f9a55).
