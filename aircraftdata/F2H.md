# F2H Banshee

## Variants

### F2H-2

- [ADC](F2H-2.json)

ADC from TSOH.

Guns changed to 20 mm M3 in [920ff11](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/920ff11b33f0c0dd66a67cb69c263f2d43b7641a). Burgess (ch. 5) states that the F2H-2 used the M3 cannon.

I can find no evidence that the F2H-2 ever carried the Sidewinder (unlike the -3 and -4). I have removed this in [33df46b](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/33df46b13d1fbacdd046920dc05c1312a0500476).

Has APG-30 gunsight radar (SAC). Added, with RE ranging, in [5d390d1](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/5d390d1a1c76958c64b80c3c3b15ba4a85020c6d).

### F2H-2P

- [ADC](F2H-2P.json)

ADC from TSOH.

Has APG-30 gunsight radar (SAC). Added, with RE ranging, in [5d390d1](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/5d390d1a1c76958c64b80c3c3b15ba4a85020c6d).

The wing-tip tanks are removable. I have added this in [c9ba021](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c9ba021a8ebef1f63b50fbae813702695a739c33), accounting for the additional load (2600 lb) and configuration points (4 for a two empty tanks).

### F2H-2B

- [ADC](F2H-2B.json)
- [ADC for variant with ATA refueling](F2H-2B%20(ATA%20Refueling).json)

ADC from TSOH.

Has APG-30 gunsight radar (SAC). Added, with RE ranging, in [5d390d1](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/5d390d1a1c76958c64b80c3c3b15ba4a85020c6d).

The wing-tip tanks are removable. I have added this in [c9ba021](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c9ba021a8ebef1f63b50fbae813702695a739c33), accounting for the additional load (2600 lb) and configuration points (4 for a two empty tanks).

The -2B could carry the Mk 7 (1700 lb) or Mk 8 (3280 lb) on a specially modified pylon on its port inner wing-root pylon (Burgess, ch. 4). The Mk 7 is in the "Pods & Ordnance 2022" spreadsheet with a weight of 1600 lb and a load of 3.5. The Mk 8 is not, but the similar Mark 27 has 5.0 load points. I have added this in [dc2fc32](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/dc2fc3206a2481c4d10d8ff21dc295159b3e0135).

The -2B was later fitted with an ATA refueling probe in place of the upper starboard cannon (Burgess, ch. 4). I have added this in [aa7954e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/aa7954e07477b4648d660945629326cf173174a5).

### F2H-3

- [ADC](F2H-3.json)
- [ADC for variant with ATA refueling](F2H-3%20(ATA%20Refueling).json)
- [ADC for RCN variant](F2H-3%20(RCN).json)

ADC from TSOH.

Guns changed to "Mk 16" in [5d8436e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/5d8436e7852fba13adb17f6b98afdd4b82310a01). The SAC for the F2H-3/4 states that it uses four "20 mm Mk.16" guns. Burgess (ch. 5) states that the M3 cannon of the earlier -2 were replaced with M12 or M16 cannon, but Chin (pp. 25–26) does not list any US 20 mm cannon with these designations; I think Burgess must be confused here.

USN F2H-3 carried Sidewinders on the inner stations (Burgess, ch. 6). Changed in [8963543](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/8963543a5a3d39fdd7c970679dcb0e0b2754e11d).

The wing-tip tanks are removable. I have added this in [c9ba021](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c9ba021a8ebef1f63b50fbae813702695a739c33), accounting for the additional load (2200 lb) and configuration points (4 for a two empty tanks).

RCN F2H-3 carried Sidewinders on the outer stations, rarely used wing-tip tanks, and were not equipped for air-to-air refueling (Burgess, ch. 6). Canada also did not use the Mk 7 or Mk 8 nuclear bomb (Wikipedia). I added this version in [dede367](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/dede36779bf9d28139da9d2f4255b9024f5817c3).

The -3 could carry the Mk 7 (1700 lb) or Mk 8 (3280 lb) on a specially modified pylon on its starboard inner wing-root pylon (Burgess, ch. 5). I added this in [4cc5293](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/4cc5293316e4da34154a957f1d3ea830ee52578d).

### F2H-4

- [ADC](F2H-4.json)
- [ADC for variant with ATA refueling](F2H-4%20(ATA%20Refueling).json)

ADC from TSOH.

The wing-tip tanks are removable. I have added this in [c9ba021](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c9ba021a8ebef1f63b50fbae813702695a739c33), accounting for the additional load (2200 lb) and configuration points (4 for a two empty tanks).

The -4 could carry the Mk 7 (1700 lb) or Mk 8 (3280 lb) on a specially modified pylon on its starboard inner wing-root pylon (Burgess, ch. 5). I added this in [4cc5293](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/4cc5293316e4da34154a957f1d3ea830ee52578d).
