# Ouragan

## ADCs

- [Ouragan](Ouragan.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Variants

The first 50 Ouragans were MD 450A models with the Nene 102 engine and the remaining 200 were MB 450B models with the Nene 104B engine (Wikipedia). It's not clear whether the ADC is for the A or B; I will assume the B.

### Original ADC

The original ADC is from Chris Perleberg. It differs from Puma's in:
- Being HTD
- Having a note about being able to carry two RKs on stations 1 to 4 and 7 to 10.

### Stores

- Can use 105 mm T-10 RKs (count as large RK).
