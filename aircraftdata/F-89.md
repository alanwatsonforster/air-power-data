## Notes and Changes

### Falcons

The F-89H Scorpion carried three Falcons and twenty-one FFARs in each wing-tip pod. The GAR-1 Falcon entered service on the F-89H in March 1956, but it was quickly replaced by the GAR-1D/-2/-2A (O’Connor, Maack p. 95). Added in [963919e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/963919ef9186ba7599dd9714eb28fab74c21c15c).

The main armament of the F-89J was a pair of MB-1 Genie rockets mounted under the wings. However, four infrared Falcons could be mounted on under-wing pylons inboard of the Genies. As mentioned above, the poor reliability of the GAR-2 when carried externally led to the development and deployment of the more robust GAR-2A, but continued problems led to these also being withdrawn and the interceptors relying only on the Genies (O’Connor, Maack. p. 96). I can find no source that mentions carrying RHMs, perhaps because the RHM Falcons were not suitable for external carriage. Added in [7a3a697](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/7a3a6975019adfb7f298b3ef58259f6faef2c312).
