## HSA

Maximum speed is 190 mph at sea level. This is comparable to the Lynx (201 mph), AH-1G Cobra (171 mph), and AH-64 (182 mph), which as HSA. I conclude that the Gazelle should be HSA too.

## Armament

- Four HOT (in French)
- Forward-firing 20 mm M621 (800 rpm)
- Two (Gulf War) or four (later) Mistral (in French)
- Latest French versions have FLIR

- M134 on French special-operation helicopters

## 20 mm M621

800 RPM is similar to the 750 RPM of the 20 mm M197 on the AH-1, so we will adapt the same values. Uses same 20 x 102 mm shell.

I don't know how much ammunition is has, but we can guess:
- HOT weights about 25 kg. With launchers say 150 kg.
- M621 weights about 45 kg
- 20 x 102 mm weights about 200 g.
- 80 kg = 400 rounds = 15 shots
