\subsection{Mil Mi-28}

The Mil Mi-28 is an attack helicopter. It was originally designed in the 1980s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union its finally entered service in 2010. The Mi-28 is a significant departure from the earlier Mi-24 and in many ways resembles the AH-64D Apache, with two crew members, heavy armor, a mast-mounted radar, and a 30 mm cannon. 

The Mi-28N (Havoc-B) version has four weapon stations, each of which can carry eight 9M120 Ataka (AT-9 Spiral-2) missiles, a B-8V20A \binarymultiply{20}{80 mm} RP, or a 23 mm UPK-23-250 GP. The Mi-28NE is a similar export version.

The Mi-28N entered service with the Russian armed forces in 2010 and has seen combat in the Invasion of Ukraine. The Mi-28NE serves in the armed forces of Iraq and Algeria.
