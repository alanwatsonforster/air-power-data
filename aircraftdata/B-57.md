## Notes and Changes

### B-57B (Early)

[Goebel](https://www.airvectors.net/avcanbra_3.html) states that the first 82 (of the total of 202) were equipped with eight .50 cal machine guns in the wings, with 300 rounds per gun, rather than four 20 mm M39 cannon and that these aircraft were not updated with the later cannon. In [aa50657](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/aa50657bca75cff56a782894343b6253c90a0883), I have added an ADC for the early B-57B. I've taken the gun characteristics from the [B-26K](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/wiki/ADCs-—-B%E2%80%9026-Invader-and-A%E2%80%9026-Counter%E2%80%90Invader) (which also had eight .50 cals), and the ammunition capacity of 7.0 is from the early F-86s (which also had 300 rounds per gun). The air-to-air characteristics of the two sets of guns are identical (to hit rolls of 4/2/1 and air-to-air rating of 5), but the air-to-ground rating of the 20 mm is better (7* compared to 6**).

### RWR

Goebel states that the B-57B initially an AN/APS-54 RWR instead of the tail-warning radar, but later was fitted with the AN/APS-54 tail-warning radar.

## Operational History
