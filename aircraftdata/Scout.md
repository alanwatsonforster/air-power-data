# Westland Scout

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Scout

Length 30 ft (fuselage or total?).
OH-58 fuselage is 34 feet, so similar size.


Two skid-mounted GPMG each with 200 rounds or a single pintle-mounted GPMG firing out of the left or right side door. 

Rate is 650 to 1000 RPM. Assume 1000 RPM. 200 rounds = 6 shots.

I assume the pintle mount also had 200 rounds, as that is a standard 7.62 mm box.

In the UH-1, we have one M60 (850 RPM) = 1/1 and one M134 (4000 RPM) = 2/2. Normally, doubling the rate of fire increases the attack rating by one. It seems the one M60 is over-rated. Nevertheless, to maintain balance we will treat the two GPMGs as one with twice the ammo.

Four SS.11 can be used with door gun.
