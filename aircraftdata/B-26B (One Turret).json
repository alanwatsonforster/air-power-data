        "Articulated Guns. In addition to its fixed guns, this variant of the B-26 is equipped with a dorsal turret with two .50 cal M2 guns. The turret can fire in any direction at targets that are at the same altitude or higher. These guns may return fire twice per game turn in response to gun attacks or conduct one attack. As there is only one gunner, it may fire on only one aircraft per game turn. The hit rolls are 2/1/1 and the only modifiers are target size and a -1 modifier when firing into the 60- arc. The AtA damage rating is 2. The ammunition is 18.0."
