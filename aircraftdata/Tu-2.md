# Tu-2

## Visibility

- Tu-2: 45 x 61 ft (Wikipedia)
- B-26: 50 x 70 ft (visibility 8)

Choose visibility 7.

## Fuel

- Range is 1260 miles (Wikipedia) or 1398 miles (Moore)
- Assuming cruise speed of 200 mph, endurance is 6 hours.
- Assuming 0.2 in N power, fuel is 360 with no reserve.
- Assuming 10% reserve, fuel is 400.

- Fuel is 616 to 793 gallons (Moor) = 200 to 260 fuel points
- Maybe the range above is total range not radius?

## Performance

- Two 1400 hp engines at 25,000 lb MTOW
- B-26 also has two engines with 2000 hp each and an MTOW of 35,000 lb, so performance will be similar.

- Max speed at sea level 315 mph (Moore)
- Max speed 330 mph (Wikipedia) or 340 mph (Goebel) or 340 mph at 18 kft (Moore)
- Rate of climb = 1600 ft/m (Wikipedia) = 0.3

- Ceiling = 30 kft (Wikipedia) or 31 kft (Goebel) or 31 kft (Moore)

- "The aircraft was fast and maneuverable like a fighter and it could survive heavy damage." (Wikipedia)

- Dive brakes on early aircraft, but removed in Tu-2S (Moore).

## Guns

- 2 × 20 mm (0.79 in) ShVAK cannons with 200 rounds (Goebel) or 150 rounds (Moore)
- Rate of fire is 750 RPM = ammunition 8

- 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS forward firing (Moore) in Tu-2 but removed in Tu-2S.

- 3 × 12.7 mm (0.50 in) rear-firing Berezin UB machine guns (earlier 7.62 mm ShKAS) with 250 rounds (Goebel)
- Rate of fire is 1000 RPM = ammunition 8
- Rate of fire is somewhere between the US .50 cal M2 and M3
- 170 to 190 rounds for navigator (Moore)
- 250 rounds for radio operator (Moore)
- 300 to 350 rounds for ventral gunner (Moor)

### Stores

- Ten RS-132 rockets under wings (Moore)
- Tu-2:
  - 1000 kg with overload of 3000 kg for short-range missions (Moore)
- Tu-2S
  - Torpedoes
  - Bombs of up to 1000 kg on wing racks
  - Drop tanks
  - Up to 3000 kg for short-range missions (Moore)
  - One 2000 kg bomb in bomb bay (Moore)
  - Three 1000 kg bombs, one in bomb bay and one under each wing (Moore)
  - Four 250 kg bombs, two in bomb bay and one under each wing (Moore)
  - Nine 100 kg bombs in bomb bay (Moore)

## Load

1 load point per 50 fuel points
1 load point per 1000 lb

CL = 1/3 fuel and no bombs = 1
1/2 = 1/3 fuel and 2200 bombs in internal bay = 3
DT = 1/3 fuel and 2200 bombs in internal bay plus two 2200 lb (4.0 each) external bombs = 11
