### P2V-7U

Officially RB-89As, but referred to as P2V-7U by the CIA

The photo at Wikipedia shows no armament.

- Cruise speed: 188 mph
- Maximum speed: 364 mph
- Ceiling: 22 kft
- Range: 4350 miles

Size:

- B-26: 50 x 70 ft      8/-1
- Il-28: 57 x 70 ft     8/-1
- B-57: 66 x 64 ft      8/-1
- B-66: 75 x 72 ft      8/-1
- B-69: 92 x 103 ft     9/-2
- B-29: 99 x 141 ft     10/-2
- Tu-16: 114 x 108 ft   10/-2

Four HVAR rails on each wing.

Bomb-bay was used for a supply container or leaflet dispenser (Pocock, p. 32).

#### Avionics

See Pocock (p.32 and p.51-52, p.79, p.84):

- APQ-24 search radar, used by USAF and more suited to use over land.
- APR-9/13 radar intercept receiver (replaced by ALQ-28 in 1959)
- QRC-15 direction-finding system
- APA-69A direction-finding display
- APA-74 pulse analyzer
- System 3 communications interceptor
- APS-54 RWR
- “a basic noise jammer”
- Doppler navigation radar (RADAN) (removed in 1959)
- APQ-56 side-looking reconnaissance radar
- ATIR (deceptive jammer) (from 1959) = DJM
- BSTR jammer (from 1962) able to jam FCR = AJM
- TFR from 1964

I assume:

- RWR C
- BJM B3 (see RB-66C).
- AJM B4 (see the RB-66C) from 1962
- DJM B4 (see the RB-66C) from 1959

I am assuming the P2V-7U was equipped with similar equipment to the RB-66C, which was introduced in 1957.

#### Chaff

Chaff dispenser from 1959 (Pocock, p. 51)

### Sidewinders

Four AIM-9B from 1964.

#### Crew

Full crew for flights over China as 11-12 (Pocock, p. 37):

- Pilot
- Copilot
- Third pilot
- Flight engineer
- Radar navigator
- Doppler radar navigator
- Visual navigator
- ECM officers (2)
- Radio operator
- Loadmaster/observer (2)
- Bomber Defense Officer (from 1959)

### Fuel

The SAC for the P2V-7 says that the internal fuel is 2980 gal plus 400 gal in wing-tip tanks.

- 2890 gal = 940 fuel points
- 200 gal = 760L = 65 fuel points each

If the fuel consumption at N power is 0.2, the endurance with internal and external fuel would be (940+130)/0.2 = 17.8 hours. The endurance in the SAC is 16 hours and some of the Black Bats missions were 15.5 hours. This suggests 0.2 is appropriate.

### Power

The engines are two Wright R-3350-32W Duplex-Cyclone with 3700 hp each and two 2 × Westinghouse J34-WE-34 turbojet engines, 3,400 lbf each and an MTO of 79,895 lb. w Thus, expect similar performance when using piston engines.

Give it 1.0 APs for HT (piston engines only) and 2.0 APs for FT (piston and jet engines). The ADC shows it limited to 260 kt = 300 mph without jet engines.

The jet engines each have 3400 lb thrust. This is about half the thrust of those in the Il-28, so use of these should give about 0.5 additional APs.

The SAC gives the maximum speed of the plain -7 with just propellers of about 240 kts (276 mph) at sea level. Pocock, p. 65, states that the maximum speed was 160 kts (184 mph) for the P2V-7 (compared to 210 for the Tu-4). We can perhaps reconcile these by the statement that ELINT equipment was very heavy (to the point that it had to be modular so that some could be removed). We can reduce the speed of the -7U by 1.0.
