# Vulcan

## Original ADCs

- Vulcan B.2 from Malcolm Pipes

### Fuel

11140 US gal = 3620 fuel points

bomb bay = 2390 US gal = 777 fuel points = 15920 lb

Malcolm Pipes allows two fuel tanks, but has the limit for the bomb bay as 28,000. I am reducing the auxiliary FTs to 14,000 each = 700 fuel points.

### Load

- Fuel load = 3620/50 = 72
- Bomb load = 21

- 1/3 fuel = 24
- 1/3 fuel + bombs = 43
