## Notes and Modifications

### Original ADC

The original ADC is one for a B-50D uploaded by Thomas Russ "Yahoo Legacy/AirPowerUploads/ADCs/ADC B50.doc" in the airpower.io files area. I have changed it extensively.


### Turn Rate

In [71c4d5a](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/71c4d5a405bc68c2a539c2618bf2c6e86f88a380), I allow the B-50 to HT when CL and otherwise TT. See the discussion in [[ADCs — Bombers]].

### Load

See the discussion on the B-29 page. We choose CL to represent the aircraft after a ferry mission (98,000 lb), 1/2 to represent the aircraft just after dropping its bombs (116,000 to 122,000 lb), and DT to represent the aircraft just before dropping its bombs (126,000 to 131,000 lb). Weight without fuel or bombs is 93,000 lb, so return missions have 23,000 to 29,000 lb of fuel after dropping bombs. The weights are taken from the SAC.

We uniformly treat 1000 lb of bombs or fuel (50 fuel points) as 1 load point.

We then have:

- DT = 32 or more
- 1/2 = 16 or more
- CL = less than 16

A return mission typically will require 25 load points of fuel.

Implemented in [f144ee5](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/f144ee57f792b7085907e494a7b7f10e4d343b5f) and [a7754e1](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/a7754e146fd944df5d831de615ede1fc9ed9285e).

### Station Weight Limits and Bomb Loads

According to the SAC, the weight limits are 20,000 lb for the bomb bay and 4,000 lb for the wing stations. Also, the bomb loads in the original ADC are awry. Fixed in [629e15e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/629e15e63b26d98343d38dc14a601caa492a45c3).

### Load Limit

According to the SAC, the B-50A/D can carry 10,000 plus internal FT plus wing FT = 33,000. Added in [d4dd431](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/d4dd431f4d700a099c3aed5b12e5a84298a6aeea).

### 700 gal FT

The wing stations can carry a 700 gal (actually 692 gal) FT (SAC, Goebel). Added in [056a26f](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/056a26fdc54c2712ca58562322ecc83a992eb7b3).

### Flight Performance

- Ceiling: CL = 39, 1/2 = 36, DT = at least 30 (say 32).
- Climb rate at LO: CL = 0.6, 1/2 = 0.5.
- Climb rate at 1/2: LO = 0.4, ML = 0.4, MH = 0.36, HI = 0.3
- Speed when 1/2: LO = 322, ML = 345, MH = 375, HI = 400 mph

Implemented in [d89180d](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/d89180dfa54e1028367c146dcd10c18acac77588).

I added similar flight rules to the B-29, but allowing it to dive up to two levels per turn in [2df1a9f](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/2df1a9fe2ad7c6136891f5732c9e76e9543ab72e) and [b2261d4](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/b2261d498c42cc6cf756c67286887137d8f98b54). This also required updating the dive speed in [6e24f0d](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/6e24f0d6b7b520d8961e7a533570d23169f2e962).

I removed LBR and HTD in [68952d3](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/68952d35afb7d63dd1dbb2805c1f853e588cee0e). If the B-26 doesn't have LBR, the B-50 should not. HTD is irrelevant as the maximum dive speed if 4.5.

### Internal Fuel

B-50A SAC:
  - Internal fuel 7195 gal = 43,200 lb = 2160 fuel points 
  - Bomb bay tank 2193 gal = 14,000 lb = 660 fuel points
  - Wing FTs each 692 gal = 5000 lb = 200 fuel points

B-50D SAC:
  - Internal fuel 8051 gal = 48,300 lb = 2400 fuel points 
  - Bomb bay tank 2193 gal = 14,250 lb = 712 fuel points
  - Wing FTs each 692 gal = 5000 lb = 225 fuel points

Added in [286f098](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/286f098a744cd133dda7426bf76fdd5937b6c470).

### ATA Refueling

Wikipedia and Goebel state that the B-50 was equipped for flying-boom refueling. Added in [fcdef65](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/fcdef651abb0713b674ccd81f51b5b094eb0f16d).

### Guns

The SAC say there were thirteen guns. Added in [3d36626](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/3d36626ba4be82d4db236e59c20ec0e98275ff28).

### Crew

Updated crew from Wikipedia in [cf53b2b](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/cf53b2b39998156ffa86ac6880cf56403cdadb60).

pilot, copilot, engineer, radio/electronic countermeasures operator, left side gunner, right side gunner, top gunner, and tail gunner.

### Saddletree

All B-50As converted to nuclear bombers under the Saddletree program (Maacke, Little). Modifications completed between May and December 1948. Apparently never served as a conventional bomber. Subsequent modifications with winterization completed for March 1949 (Maacke, Little). Includes large single tank in bomb bay.

Reading Maack, Little, and Ailing, it seems that the B-50D did not have a similar program, but rather was dual purpose.

### Bombs

The B-50 used:

- [Mark 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_4_nuclear_bomb) weight 11,000
- [Mark 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_5_nuclear_bomb) weight 3,000
- [Mark 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_6_nuclear_bomb) weight 8,000

Added in [26fa984](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/26fa984f27606b57c35d01f5da5faececc75eb98).

### Bomb Bay FT

The SAC shows a bomb bay FT with a capacity of 2250 gal (8500L, weight 14000, 730 fuel points).

### Power

Knaacke says the B-50 had 56% more power. At 1/2, the power to weight ratio increased by 1.56*100/130 = 1.20. This is not dramatic.

### ECM

I assume the B50 has RWR-A, BJM-A2, and a countermeasures operator, like the B-29. Added in [79fe2c9](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/79fe2c969d45a8bf2ad62b204ef4803ba6acb02e).

## Operational History

In service June 1948 (Wikipedia).

B-50A in services from 1948 to 1954 (Maacke).

B-50D in service from 1949 to 1955 (Maacke).
