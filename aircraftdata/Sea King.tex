\subsection{Westland Sea King}

The Westland Sea King is a anti-submarine and medium-lift transport helicopter. It is a licensed adaptation of the Sikorsky S-61, with many British components including the engines and the flight control system.

The HAS.1/2/5/6 differ principally in their anti-submarine systems evolved with time. The HC.4 is a specially adapted version for Commando assault. The HU.5 is an HAS.5 converted to a pure transport and utility helicopter by removing the anti-submarine equipment. The AEW.2/5 and ASaC.7 are airborne early warning and control version, with the Shearwater radar carried in a pod on the right side of the fuselage.

All can be equipped with a pintle-mounted gun in the door on the right side of the fuselage, although this is probably not likely in the AEW versions. In RN service, the 7.62 mm GPMG is used. In service with the German Navy, a .50 cal M2 machine gun is used.

The Sea King HAS served in the RN from 1969 until 2019 and the HC.4 from 1990 to 2016. It saw combat in the South Atlantic War, the Gulf War, the Balkans, during the invasion and occupation of Iraq, and in Afghanistan. Anti-submarine versions were also used by the RAN and the navies of Belgium, Germany, India, Egypt, Norway, Pakistan. Transport versions are used by Egypt, Qatar, and Ukraine.
