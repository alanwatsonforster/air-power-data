The Dassault Mirage III is a supersonic interceptor and multirole aircraft.

\subsection{Versions}

\subsubsection{Mirage IIIEA}

The IIIEA version was bought by the Argentinian FAA and saw combat in the South Atlantic War.

\subsection{Armament and Stores}

The gun armament is two 30~mm DEFA cannons.

For air-to-air missions, the central station can carry an R.530 RHM or IRM, and the two outer wing stations can carry R.550 Magic IRMs.

To increase endurance, 500L, 900L, 1100L, 1300L, or 1700L fuel tanks could be carried, although only the 500L and 900L tanks could be carried at supersonic speeds. Not all tanks were available to all users. The original French 500L tanks were fixed, but jettisonable versions were later developed by Israel.

\subsection{Combat}

Argentine FAA Mirage IIIEAs saw combat in the 1982 South Atlantic War.
