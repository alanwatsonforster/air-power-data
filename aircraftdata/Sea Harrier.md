# Sea Harrier

## Sea Harrier FRS.1

* [ADC](Sea%20Harrier%20FRS.1.json)

ADC from the TSOH 2nd edition collection.

The rolls of 4/2/1 and damage rating of 3 for one gun seem suspicious. The corresponding figures for two guns are 6/3/2 and 6. Typically, the rating is increased by one for each additional gun or pair of guns (see section 9.1 and ADCs of aircraft armed with multiple .50 cal or 20 mm cannon). This would suggest 4/2/1 and 5 for one gun.

## Sea Harrier FRS.2/FA.2

* [ADC](Sea%20Harrier%20FRS.2.json)/[ADC](Sea%20Harrier%20FA.2.json)

The ADC for the FRS.2 is from the TSOH 2nd edition collection.

I have modified the note on the maximum vertical take-off weight to match the FRS.1.

The FA.2 is simply a later redesignation of the FRS.2.
