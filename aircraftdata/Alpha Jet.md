## ADCs

- [Alpha Jet A](Alpha%20Jet%20A.json)
- [Alpha Jet E](Alpha%20Jet%20E.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

ADCs for the Alpha Jet appear in *Air Strike*.

### Alpha Jet A

This is the attack (Appui Tactique) version initially used by the Luftwaffe.

### Alpha Jet E

This is the trainer version (École) version initially used by the Armée de l'Air.

### FTs

Could carry FTs with capacities of 310L (82 US gal) or 450L (119 US gal) (Goebel).

### GPs

- Single Mauser 27 mm GP (Goebel) with 150 rounds (Wikipedia). ROF is 1000-1700 RPM = 4.5 to 2.6 ammo.

- DEFA 30 mm GP (Goebel) with 150 rounds (Wikipedia). Model is DEFA 553 (Wikipedia on DEFA). ROF is 1300 RPM = 3.5 ammo. Seems to be CC420 (see GP notes).

### ICE Upgrade

The ICE upgrade to the A was to provide compatibility with Mavericks, but this was cancelled in 1988 and a more austere upgrade from 1989 which gave the AIM-9Ls and the ability to jettison the gun pod (Wikipedia).

The A may use Maverick RSs.

### PP

“The French qualified a film-camera pod” (Goebel).
