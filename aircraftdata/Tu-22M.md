# Tu-22M

## ADCs

- Malcolm Pipes has ADCs for the M2 and M3

## Notes

### Geometry

The original ADC suggest that the wings sweep automatically according to speed (forward at 3.5 or less; mid at 4.0 to 6.0; and aft at 6.5 or more), but also that they can only be changed if the turn rate is TT or less.

I've modified this. I keep the minimum speeds, but set maximum speeds of 4.0 for aft and LT - 0.5 for mid.

### Weapons

- Kh-22M/MA (Goebel)

- Two wing pylors for KH.22 or MER (Goebel)

  - 9 on each external station (4950) with MR (400) (confirmed in Wikipedia)
  - 33 in bomb bay (18150)
  - Total = 38,750
- 42 x 1100 BB (Goebel)
  - 6 each on external stations (6600) with MR (400)
  - 18 in bomb bay (19800)
  - Total = 47,000
- Mixed (Goebel)
  - Two 6600 on external stations
  - Two 3300 on external stations
  - 6 x 3300 in bomb bay (19800)
  - Total = 34,400
- Two AS-4
  - Total = 24,000
- Three AS-4
  - Total = 36,000

No hint of BG or RG.

### Loads

- CL = 1/3 fuel = 2000 fuel points = 40 load points
- 1/2 = 1/3 fuel plus two missiles = 58 load points
