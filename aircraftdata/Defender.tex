\subsection{Hughes 500 Defender}

The Hughes 500 Defender is a light attack helicopter. It was developed in the 1970s from the civilian Hughes 500 which in turn was derived from the OH-6.

The Defender has two weapon stations on the fuselage sides each of which can carry two TOW RGs, one M27 GP with a 7.62 mm M134 minigun with 2000 rounds, one FN HMP400 0.50 cal GP with 400 rounds, one $7\times 70$~mm RP, or two AIM-92 Stinger IRMs.

The Defender served with many armed forces and saw combat with Israeli Air Force against Syrian forces in the late 1970s and 1980s.
