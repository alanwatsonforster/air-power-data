\subsection{Aérospatiale Puma}

The Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma is a medium transport helicopter. It was originally developed by Sud Aviation which later became part of Aérospatiale. It was introduced in 1968 and was widely adapted in the 1970s.

Many versions have improved infrared countermeasures. All offer the ability to mount guns on both doors, although typically only one is mounted.

The variants in RAF service were the HC.1 (which entered service in 1971) and the HC.2 (which entered service in 2012). They saw combat in the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. They were retired in 2025. The Puma also served in the Argentinian forces in the South Atlantic War.
