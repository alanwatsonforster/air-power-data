## Notes and Changes

### Wild Weasel

I've split the F-100F into an original (e.g., for Misty FAC), Wild Weasel I (RWR), and Wild Weasel II (RWR + Shrike).

The Wild Weasel ADCs need specifications of the ECM pods.

### RWR

Did the original F-100F also get RWR-A in 1968?

### Ranging Radar

The ranging radar is the APG-30 (Wikipedia). Added in [b8ab6a3](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/b8ab6a36ea45fb13727fba54fa48a7f61633c036).

## Operational History
