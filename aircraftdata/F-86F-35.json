    "description": "The North American F-86F-35 Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, fighter-bomber, and tactical nuclear bomber. The F-86F-35 is similar to the F-86F-25 but the inner left weapon station is reinforced to allow carriage of a Mk 12 nuclear bomb and the aircraft is equipped with the LABS system to allow toss bombing. This variant is the original, with the early slatted wing.",
