# Notes and Changes

## Radar

The radar in the RF-4B/C was initially APQ-99, later upgraded in the RF-4C to the APQ-168 (possibly) and AN/APQ-172 (Wikipedia). Changed in [98d392b](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/98d392ba4934514e84b7c0addaa660188a7c7ffa).

  - From introduction in F-4E/F-4J
- RWR-B:
  - 1971 for F-4B/RF-4B/F-4C/RF-4C/F-4E/F-4J
- DDS-A
  - 1967 for F-4B/RF-4B
  - 1971 for F-4C/RF-4C/F-4E
  - From introduction in F-4J
- DDS-B:
  - 1975: DDS-B F-4B/RF-4B/F-4C/RF-4C/F-4E/F-4J

Also F-4B/RF-4B/F-4J have DJM-A3.
