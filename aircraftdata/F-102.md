# F-102 Delta Dagger

## Versions and Variants

### F-102A

- [ADC](F-102A.json)
- [ADC](F-102A.json)

ADC from TSOH.

The late version has IRSTS-A, AIM-26 capability, and no FFARs.

## Notes and Changes

### Missiles

The F-102 could originally carry six AIM-4 missiles, two each in a left, center, and right weapons bay. In about 1962, the center bay was modified to carry either AIM-26 missiles in addition to AIM-4s, but the FFARs were eliminated (O'Connor). I've incorporated these changes in the Late version. Added in [cfa2143](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/cfa2143ff26a950bce93cee8417d95d48a193135).

### Bays

I have split out the bays into two side bays and one central bay. I've given weight limits of 280 lb (two GAR-2A/-2B) to the outer bays and 280 lb (two GAR-2A/-2B) to the central bay in the earlier version and 520 lb (two AIM-26B) to the central bay in the later version. The increase in weight in the later version is justified by the loss of 432 lb of FFARs (weight from the SAC). Changed in [6efc0a7](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/6efc0a72b6813b6d050fa6ec743cee89c479cc0b).

## Operational History

Introduced in April 1956 (Wikipedia).
