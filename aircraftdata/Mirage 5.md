# Mirage 5


## ADCs

- [Mirage VF](Mirage%20VF.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Name

I see “Mirage 5” more than I see "Mirage V".

### Original ADCs

An ADC for the Mirage VF appears in *Air Strike*.

Errata for stations 3 and 5.

There is an ADC for a Mirage IIIE in APJ 44, with many subtle differences.

### Radar ECCM

No ECCM in original ADC. ECCM of 0 taken from APJ 21.

### Ejection Seat

Std from APJ 21.

### Renumber Stations

In the original ADC, stations 1 to 5 are the same as on the Mirage III and stations 6 and 7 are under the rear fuselage. I have renumbered them conventionally from right to left.

### Overloading Stations

APJ 21 allows the inner wing stations to be overloaded to 3000 lb. Perleberg's ADC allows them to be overloaded to 3300 lb with FT/RPT/MRT.

### RHMs

The *Air Strike* ADC states that it can use Matra 530 RHMs on the centerline station, but I suspect this is only the air superiority variant with Agave radar. I suspect the radar-less VF can only use IRMs. I have modified the ADC to reflect this.

### Properties

LTD and PSSM from APJ 21.
