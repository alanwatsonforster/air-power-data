\subsection{Aérospatiale Gazelle}

The Aérospatiale Gazelle is a scout and light attack helicopter. It was originally developed by Sud Aviation which later became part of Aérospatiale as a successor to the Alouette III.

It can be armed with a fixed 20 mm M621 gun, four HOT RGs, or two or four Mistral IRMs. The latest {\itshape Viviane} versions in French service have TV/IR optics.

Various versions of Gazelle served in the French Army from 1973 in scout, anti-tank, and anti-helicopter roles. In combat roles, it is being replaced by the Eurocopter Tiger, but still serves in utility roles. The 20 mm, HOT, and dual Mistral versions saw combat in the Gulf War. The Gazelle has also seen combat in many French interventions in former African colonies.

The Gazelle AH.1 served in the British Army from 1973 to 2023 in the scout and utility roles alongside the anti-tank Lynx AH.1. It saw combat in the South Atlantic War, the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War.

The Gazelle is widely used by the armed forces of other countries, especially former French colonies.
