# MiG-27

## ADCs

- [Mig-27](MiG-27.json) (Flogger-D)

## Notes and Changes

### Source ADCs

An ADC for the MiG-27 was included with *Air Strike*. The ADC used here is from Malcolm Pipe’s collection in the files section of the airpower.io group.

### Speeds

The source ADC states that speeds “must remain less than *subsonic*” if the wings are in the forward position. Comparing to the MiG-23 ADC in APJ 44, this should be “must remain less than *transonic*”.

The source ADC states that speeds “up to high transonic” are allowed if the wings are in the middle position. Note that the maximum speed at LO altitude in DT configuration is limited to 6.5, which is low transonic.
