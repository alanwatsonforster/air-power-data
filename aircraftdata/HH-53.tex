\subsection{Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion and HH-53}

The Sikorsky CH-53/HH-53 is a heavy transport and SAR helicopter. It was developed from the CH-3 and the CH-54.  The CH-53 version is known as the Sea Stallion, and the HH-53 versions are not officially named but are known informally as the “Super Jolly Green Giant” or “Super Jolly”.

The CH-53 was developed as a heavy-lift transport helicopter for the USMC. The A and D versions served with the USMC, the D version with the Israeli Air Force, and the G version with the German Army. 

The USAF versions are the HH-53B, HH-53C, and CH-53C. The HH-53B CSAR version, delivered in 1968, has a refueling probe, drop tanks, armor, a rescue hoist, and three 7.62 mm miniguns on the left, right, and rear doors. The HH-53C version, also delivered in 1968, has smaller external fuel tanks, but more armor and better communications equipment. The CH-53C version was similar to the HH-53C, including armor and door guns, but lacks the refueling probe.

The HH-53B and HH-53C served in the USAF in CSAR roles, replacing the HH-3E, and saw  combat in the Vietnam War.
