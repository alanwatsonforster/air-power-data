\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MiG-15UTI.jpg}

The Shenyang JJ-2 was a trainer, a licensed copy of the MiG-15UTI.

Many Soviet-built MiG-15bis fighters served in the PLAAF under the designation J-2, but unlike the JJ-2 the J-2 was not manufactured in China.

\subsection{Versions}

\subsubsection{JJ-2 and FT-2}

The Shenyang JJ-2 was a licensed copy of the MiG-15UTI trainer. The MiG-15UTI in turn was essentially a MiG-15 with a second cockpit and reduced armament. The FT-2 was the export version of the JJ-2. The NATO reporting name is Midget.

It was used extensively by the PLAAF and PLAN.

\subsection{Armament and Stores}

It is conceivable that the JJ-2 used the same stores as the MiG-15, especially 250L FTs.

\subsection{Combat}

The PLAN used the JJ-2 to attempt to intercept ROCAF overflights around 1960.
