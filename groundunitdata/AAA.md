# AAA

## General Notes

### Sections and Batteries

Some weapons have both trailer-mounted and mobile versions. The former will often be a battery of four to six guns. The latter will typically be a section of two vehicles. This explains some of the apparent contradictions in the hit rolls.

For example, let us compare batteries and sections with identical guns:

- The mobile ZPU-4 section and towed ZPU-4 battery in *Air Strike* have hit rolls of 3/3/2 and 5/4/3. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1 or +2.

- The mobile M163 section and towed M167 battery in *Air Strike* have hit rolls of 5/4/3 and 6/5/4. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1.

- The truck-mounted ZU-23 section and towed ZU-23 battery in *Air Strike* have hit rolls of 2/2/1 and 4/3/2. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +2 or +1.

- The Blazer section and towed GEMAG battery in *Air Strike* have hit rolls of 5/4/3 and 6/5/4. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1.

- The Nile-23 section in *Eagles of the Gulf* and the ZU-23 battery in *Air Strike* have hit rolls of 3/3/2 and 4/3/2. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1 or +0.

- The M16 section and the M55 battery in *Eagles of the Gulf* have hit rolls of 4/3/2 and 5/4/3. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1.

- The M3 TCM section and TCM battery in *Eagles of the Gulf* have hit rolls of 3/3/2 and 4/4/3. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +1.

- The Gepard section and Oerlikon GDF battery in *Air Strike* have identical hit rolls of 5/4/3, but this is somewhat misleading since the Gepard has an integral FCR. If we add an external FCR-B/C to the Oerlikon GDF unit, its hit rolls are 7/6/5. Here, the change from section to battery increases the hit rolls by +2.

In all of these cases, the section and battery have identical ranges, maximum altitude, and damage ratings.

In all of these cases except one (the Nile-23 at long range), the step-up from a section to a battery gives an improvement in the hit rolls of +1 or +2.

It's difficult to determine under what circumstances the improvement is +1 or +2. The +2 improvement is only for the ZPU-4 and ZU-23 at short range and the Gepard at all ranges. These might be oversights. It might be that in general the improvement is +1.

### Batteries of Mobile AAA

If you want to create a battery of mobile AAA (e.g., a battery of six ZPU-4 mounted on trucks rather than a section of two), use the towed battery AAA values with the mobile section defense strength and spotting range. You'll have to invent the VPs.

## Light AAA

### M2 platoon

This is the M2 .50 cal heavy machine gun on a M63 dual-purpose mount.

I'm not sure if “battery” is the right term for an AA HMG unit. Perhaps platoon is better?

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_Browning)

### DShK platoon

Origin: EOG and Puma.

Again, I'm not sure if “battery” is the right term for an AA HMG unit. Perhaps platoon is better?

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DShK)

### M55 battery

The M55 is M45 quad .50 cal mount on a trailer.

Origin: EOG and Puma.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M45_quad_mount)

### Mobile M55 section

This is the M45 quad .50 cal mounted on a truck, such as the M35 2.5 ton or M54 5-ton truck.

Origin: Derived from M16 with the defense strength of Czech M53.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M45_quad_mount)

### M16 section

The M16 is an M45 quad .50 cal mount on a modifier M3 half-track.

Origin: EOG and Puma.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M45_quad_mount)

### ZPU-1 battery

This is the single mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: EOG, TSOH, and Puma.

Puma gives the long range as 4 hexes, but EOG and TSOH give it as 5 hexes. Furthermore, Puma gives the long range for the ZPU-2 and ZPU-4 as 5 hexes. I have adopted the EOG and TSOH values.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPU)

### ZPU-2 battery

This is the twin mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike has hit rolls of 4/3/2 and a damage rating of 1. Puma has hit rolls of 4/3/1 and a damage rating of 3. Comparing to the ZPU-1 and ZPU-4, the Air Strike values seem to be more reasonable, and I have adopted it.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPU)

### ZPU-4 battery

This is the quad mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: Air Strike, TSOH, and Puma.

Air Strike and Puma have hit rolls of 5/4/3. TSOH has hit rolls of 4/3/2, which matches the ZPU-2 in Air Strike and Puma. I have adopted the Air Strike values.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPU)

### Mobile ZPU-1 section

This is the single mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: None

Applying the -1 battery-to-section modifier to the ZPU-1, I get 2/1/0 and 2 VPs.

### Mobile ZPU-1 section

This is the single mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: None

Applying the -1 battery-to-section modifier to the ZPU-2, I get 3/2/1 and 3 VPs.

### Mobile ZPU-4 section

This is the quad mount version of 14.5 mm ZPU gun.

Origin: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike has hit rolls of 3/3/2. Puma has hit rolls of 5/4/3. The Puma values are equal to those of as ZPU-4 *battery*. The Air Strike values might be more appropriate for a section. I have chosen to use 4/3/2 obtained by applying the -1 battery-to-section modifier to the values for a ZPU-4 battery.

Air Strike gives this 5 VPs, which is the same as the towed ZPU-4 battery despite the mobile section having worse hit rolls and defense strength. I think 4 VPs (i.e., one less than the battery) is more appropriate.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPU)

### TCM-20 Battery

This is a pair of Hispano-Suiza 20 mm cannon mounted on an M45 turret.

Origen: EOG.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M45_quad_mount#TCM-20)
- [Weapons Systems](https://weaponsystems.net/system/750-TCM-20)

### M3 TCM-20 Section

This is a pair of Hispano-Suiza 20 mm cannon mounted on an M45 turret and mounted in an M3 half-track. (The M16 half-track was not used, surprisingly.)

Origen: EOG.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M45_quad_mount#TCM-20)
- [Weapons Systems](https://weaponsystems.net/system/786-M3%20TCM-20)

### Rh-202 Battery

This is a twin-mount of the Rh-202 cannon.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike also has a single-mount version, but I can find no evidence for this other than as the main weapon of IFVs (e.g., the Marder) or on naval mounts.

Air Strike has hit rolls of 5/4/3 and a damage rating of 2. Puma has hit rolls of 3/2/1, which match those of the single gun version in Air Strike, and a damage rating of 3, which is more than most 20 mm except for the M163/M167. The rate of fire of the twin Rh-202 is about 2000 RPM, but that of the M163/167 is about 3000 RPM, so it seems appropriate damage rating of the Rh-202 is less than that of the M163/M167. I adopt the Air Strike values for the twin mount in both cases.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall_Mk_20_Rh-202)

### Panhard M3 DCA Section

This is the Panhard M3 with a turret with two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza guns.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma

Wikipedia and Weapon Systems comment that they have optical sights, but could be equipped with a *search* radar, which Weapon Systems state could feed the range and speed into the targeting computer. The radar does not seem to be able to *track* or *lay the guns*. I have therefore added R capability.

An R capability would normally add 2 to the hit rolls, but that would give 5/5/4, which is better than the ZSU-23-4 (5/4/3) and Gepard (5/4/3)! Adding one would give 4/4/3, which seems more appropriate.

Wikipedia states that this is E-band, which 2-3 GHz and corresponds to the UF band.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhard_M3)
- [Weapon Systems](https://weaponsystems.net/system/532-VDAA)

### M163 Section

This is the 20 mm Vulcan mounted on an M113.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike has hit rolls of 5/4/3. Puma has hit rolls of 6/5/4, which is the same as the value given by both for a M167 *battery*. It seems the Air Strike values are more appropriate for a section, and I adopt them here.

Wikipedia states this can use IR night sights.

Werrell (p. 73) states that the range-only radar was added in 1984 to the PIVADS.

- [Werrell: Archie to SAM](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Mar/31/2001725225/-1/-1/0/B_0028_WERRELL_ARCHIE_TO_SAM.PDF)

### M167 Battery

This is the 20 mm Vulcan on a trailer mount.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M167_VADS)

### ZU-23 Battery

This is the twin 23 mm gun on a towed mount.

Origen: Air Strike, TSOH, and Puma.

Air Strike has VPs of 5/4/3. TSOH has VPs of 6/4/2. I adopt the TSOH values.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZU-23-2)

### Mobile ZU-23 Section

This is the twin 23 mm gun mounted on a truck.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike gives this hit rolls of 2/2/1 and 5 VPs. Applying the \minus{1} modifier to the ZU-23 battery would give 3/2/1, which seems more appropriate. The VPs seem about right, as the battery has 6 VPs.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZU-23-2)

### Sinai 23

The turret seems to be similar to the LAV-AD turret, so I've adopted the same hit rolls. The range and damage rolls are adopted from the mobile ZU-23 section.

A battery has one search radar (precision 1 degree so not FCR) vehicle and three gun/launcher vehicles. It looks like the radar can cue aiming.

Has six Ayn-al-Sadr (SA-7B clone) or Stingers according to Wikipedia.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZU-23-2)
- [Warthunder](https://forum.warthunder.com/t/british-weapon-systems-technical-data-and-discussion/3879/2234)

### ZSU-23-4 Section

This is the Shilka SPAAG.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZSU-23-4_Shilka)

### LAV-AD Section

This is the air-defense version of the LAV-25, with a 25 mm cannon and eight Stingers.

Origin: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike has the Bradley Blazer, but this did not enter service. However, the LAV-AD has a similar turret and we use this as a substitute.

The Blazer turret can be equipped with radar, but the LAV-AD has it. Instead, Global Security states that it has a day-and-night TV/FLIR capability.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV-25#Other_Variants)
- [Global Security](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1991/DCR.htm
)

### M53/59 Section

This is the Czech mobile twin 30 mm SPAAG.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

The hit rolls of 4/3/2 in Air STrike seem a little high. A modern 23/30/35 mm section with FCR typically has 5/4/3 and the mobile ZU-23 has 2/2/1. I adopt 3/2/1.

If the VADS is classed as armored, should this be armored too? Perhaps the difference is that the loaders are exposed in this?

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M53/59_Praga)

### AMX-30 SA Section

This has two 30 mm Hispano-Suiza cannons in a turret on an adapted AMX-30 tank.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

The AMX-30 DCA has the same radar and guns were used on the AMX-13 DCA. The SA was apparently improved in some way (radar tracking?).

I presume the Air Strike DCA is really the SA.

Air Strike has ranges of 4/7/9 and a maximum altitude of 11. Puma has the AMX-13 DCA with ranges of 3/6/9 and a maximum altitude of 10. The Hispano-Suiza 831A uses a 30x170 mm shell. The Tunguska and Pantsir use a similar 30x165 mm shell. I adopt the Air Strike values, as they match those of the Tunguska and Pantsir.

It is equipped with an Oeil Noir 1 radar. Wikipedia states that the guns “received information” from the radar, but that tracking was optical and limited to daylight and clear weather. However, Weapon Systems states that manual control was an alternate to radar control.

Air Strike has the AMX-30 DCA with W/VF radar. Puma has the AMX-13 with a W/LF radar. I will adopt the Air Strike values, as most similar contemporary radars in the game are VF.

For the AMX-30SA, I adopt the Air Strike values given for the AMX-30 DCA. The real DCA does not have radar, but the Air Strike one does, matching the SA.

- [Wikipedia on 30 mm shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber)
- [AMX-30SA](https://tank-afv.com/coldwar/Saudi/Saudi-Arabian-Tanks.php)

### Tunguska Section

This is the 2K22 Tunguska.

Origen: Air Strike (as the ZSU-30-2 and without missiles) and Puma.

Note that the ready missile count

I have adopted the Air Strike values for the ZSU-30-2 and added missiles. The VP values are tentative, and might be modified once other SAM launchers are considered.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K22_Tunguska)

### Pantsir Section

This is the Pantsir S1 and S1M.

Origen: Puma.

Puma gives the Pantsir S1 as using the SA-19 and the S1M as using the SA-22. All other sources I have seen give both using the SA-22.

Puma gives the defense strength as 3H, but the S1 and S1M do not seem to have significant armor. I adopt 3S.

Puma does not give VPs. As an AAA platform, it is similar to the Tunguska, but less well protected. As a SAM platform, it is slightly better as it have more missiles and they are faster.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantsir_missile_system)

## Medium AAA

### Oerlikon GDF Battery

This is the Oerlikon GDF 35 mm towed AAA.

What about making the battery/section from the Oerlikon to the Gepard only +1? Taking FCR-B/C into account, this would give the Oerlikon hit rolls compared to others of:

- ZU-23: 4/3/2 (2000 RPM/mount)
- Oerlikon: 4/3/2 (1100 RPM/mount)
- M38: 3/2/1
- L/60: 2/2/1 (120 RPM/mount)
- L/70: 3/3/2 (350 RPM/mount)
- L/70 BOFI: 4/4/3
That doesn't seem to bad. It's better than the earlier L/60 and M38, slightly better than the slightly earlier L/70, and slightly worse than the later BOFI. It's the same as the ZU-23, but this has a much higher ROF (2000 RPM/mount) and probably worse sights.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_GDF)

### Gepard Section

This is the Gepard 35 mm SPAAG.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike has ranges of 4/8/10. Puma has ranges of 4/8/12. Comparing to similar weapons, I adopt 4/8/10.

Air Strike has a damage rating of 4. Puma has a damage rating of 5. Comparing to similar weapons, I adopt 4.

I have adopted the Air Strike values.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flakpanzer_Gepard)

### M-38 Battery

This is the Soviet M-1939 or 61-K 37 mm towed gun.

Origen: Air Strike, TSOH, and Puma.

Air Strike has VPs of 5/3/2. TSOH has VPs of 6/4/2. I will adopt the TSOH VPs.

This is what Air Strike and TSOH call the “M-38”, but I've no idea why. Its other designation is M-1939, so I could understand “M-39“. I have adopted the values from TSOH, which are the same as those in Air Strike, but TSOH gives it 6 VPs and Air Strike only 5.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37_mm_automatic_air_defense_gun_M1939_(61-K))

### Bofers L/60 Battery

This is the earlier Bofers 40 mm L/60 towed gun.

Origen: EOG and Puma.

Air Strike has VPs of 5/3/2. TSOH has VPs of 6/4/2. I will adopt the TSOH VPs.

EOG gives hit rolls of 2/2/1 and 5 VPs. I have adjusted the hit rolls to 3/2/1 to match the very similar 37 mm 61-K.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_L/60_gun)

### Bofers L/70 Battery

This is the later Bofers 40 mm L/70 towed gun.

I have adopted the values from Air Strike.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Wikipedia states that the L/70 has a longer range than the L/60, but this is not reflected in the given ranges.

Singh (Ch. 4) states that Israel had 200 L/70s and used them with the Super Fledermaus to defend strategic locations.

Wikipedia states that the Netherlands used it the KL/MSS-6720 Flycatcher radar system for base defense.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_Automatic_Gun_L/70)
- [Weapon Systems](https://weaponsystems.net/system/932-Bofors%20L/70)
- [Flycatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flycatcher_(radar))

### Bofers L/70 BOFI and BOFI-R

This is Bofers 40 mm L/70 with an improved optical fire-control system, laser rangefinder, proximity-fuzed ammunition and, in the case of the BOFI-R, an integrated all-weather FCR.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Power has the BOFI as having an FCR and with hit rolls of 4/4/3. However, adding an FCR-B/C to a plain L/70 battery will give effective hit rolls of 5/5/4.

I take the L/70 and add +1 for proximity fuzes, +1 for BOFI laser rangefinder, and another +1 for BOFI-R radar.
I adopt 4/4/3 for the BOFI and 5/5/4 for the BOFI-R.

Air Strike gives VPs as 8/6/4. A plain L/70 with an FCR-B is 12/8/4.

I don't see a search radar in photos of the BOFI-R.

I don't know when the BOFI and BOFI-R became available.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

- [Weapon Systems](https://weaponsystems.net/system/932-Bofors%20L/70)

### S-60 Battery

This is the Soviet S-60 57 mm towed gun.

Origen: Air Strike, TSOH, and Puma.

Air Strike and TSOH give hit rolls of 2/2/1. Puma gives hit rolls of 1/1/0, which is even worse than the KS-19. I adopt the TSOH values.

Air Strike gives the VPs as 6/4/2. TSOH gives them as 8/5/3.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZP_S-60)

### ZSU-57-2

Origen: EOG

I have adopted the EOG hit rolls of 2/1/1. The S-60 battery has 2/2/1 and the normal -1 modifier would suggest the ZSU-57-2 have 1/1/0, but in this case a smaller difference is justified as we are comparing four barrels to six.

## Heavy AA

### KS-12 Battery

This is the Soviet 85 mm towed gun.

Origen: Air Strike and TSOH.

There are two KS-12 guns. The M-1939 is given a maximum altitude of 34k feet by Wikipedia and 25k feet by Singh. The M-1944 is given a maximum altitude of 38k ft by Wikipedia 29k ft by Singh. The game versions have maximum altitudes of 27k ft, which is half-way between the figures given by Singh.

Air Strike gives the VPs as 7/5/3. TSOH gives them as 9/6/5. The TSOH values fit better with other ones.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85_mm_air_defense_gun_M1939_(52-K))

### KS-19 Battery

This is the Soviet 100 mm towed gun.

Origen: Air Strike and Puma.

Air Strike gives hit rolls as 1/1/0 (see errata). Puma gives 2/1/0. I adopt the Air Strike Values.

Air Strike gives VPs as 8/5/3, but this seems undervalues compared to the TSOH values for the S-60 and KS-12. I adopt 10/7/3.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KS-19)

## TODO

- Mobile ZPU-2 (on truck, BTR-40, or BTR-152)

## Comparison of AAA Batteries

These are the original values from Air Strike, EOG, and TSOH.

|Type|Caliber|Range|Altitude|Hit Rolls|Damage|RPM/mount|Velocity|Suggestion|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M55|12.7 mm|2/3/4|5|5/4/3|2||||

|KS-19|100 mm|7/14/21|39|1/1/0|6||||

Principal: hit rolls should depend on

- RPM/mount
- Muzzle velocity
- Sight
- Proximity fuzes

Damage should depend on caliber.

Suggestion:

- S-60 = 2/2/1 (lowest RPM) = YES
- M-38 = L/60 = 3/2/1 = YES
- L/70 = 4/3/2 (better RPM and better velocity)
- BOFI = 5/4/3 (like L/70, but laser ranging and proximity fuzes)
- ZU-23 = 6/5/4 (like L/70, but much better RPM)
- GDF = 5/4/3 (like L/70, but better RPM)

If we are to have a +1 modifier from section to battery, with the Gepard has to be 4/3/2 or the GDF (without FCR) has to be 4/3/2. Or we abandon the idea that the modifier is always +1.

Base at zero range is 5 or more = +2 otherwise +1.

The current ratings have the GDF being awesome. Perhaps the only adjustment needed is L/60 = M-38?
