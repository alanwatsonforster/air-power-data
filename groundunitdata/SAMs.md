# SAMs

## Ayn-al-Sadr

The Sinai 23 has six.

Mentioned as 1984 copy of SA-7B [here](https://www.armedconflicts.com/Ayn-al-Saqr-Sakr-Eye-t265986).

- [Wikipedia on ZU-23 and Sinai 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZU-23-2)

## SA-2B/C/D/F

### SA-2 Launch Unit

- From TSOH and EOTG.
- Values adopted from Puma
- TSOH give this an EWR. Wikipedia suggest EWR at regimental level. I note that the SA-4 in AS does not. This may be a change in JDW's thinking between AS and TSOH.
- We call it a battery, but it would actually be a battalion.

### SA-2 Missiles

- From TSOH and EOTG
- Values adopted from Puma

## SA-3B

### SA-3 Launch Unit

- From EOTG; I assume it is a SA-3B as SA-3s were supplied to Egypt in 1970.
- Values adopted from Puma
- Towed version seems to correspond to four quad launchers and four twin launchers in the mobile version.
- Puma has the mobile version correspond to only two launchers, which seems wrong. I have expanded this to four. He also has the 3A on fixed mounts and the 3B on mobile mounts, but I suspect the 3B is used on both.

### SA-3 Missiles

- SA-3 was supplied to Egypt in 1970, so probably the SA-3B version. Support for this is that Puma has the SA-3A without OG.
- Values adopted from Puma, except that Puma gives a speed of 20-0 for CW mode and 14-2 for OG mode, which seems unlikely. I use 20 for both.

## SA-4

- Probably SA-4B 9M8M1, which was introduced in 1967.

### SA-4 Launch Units

- From AS.
- Puma has a defense strength of 6H, which is difficult to understand. I use the 3H from AS.
- Puma seems to correspond to two dual armored TELs. AS has three TELs. Wikipedia suggests that 3 is correct.
- AS has no EWR. Puma has VF/50.
- Wikipedia suggests P-40 Long Track EWR at regimental level.

### SA-4 Missile

- AS does not give sustainer.
- Adopt values from Puma.

## SA-6

### SA-6 Launch Units

- From AS (B) and EOTG (A)
- Values taken from Puma.
- The defense strength of 6H seems high, even though it comes from AS. I will use 3H, like the SA-4 in AS.
- Wikipedia says the radar vehicle has an EWR 1S11 (Straight Flush) and an illuminator 1S31. The range of the EWR is 30 miles. However, it can be used with other EWRs with longer ranges, including Spoon Rest, Long Track, and Flat Face.
- Seems to be four triple TELs with one radar.
- Puma has a volley number of 3, but AS has 2. Wikipedia says only 1 or 2 missiles can be guided. I adopt 2.
- Wikipedia says the SA-6B is mounted on a new vehicle with the Fire Dome guidance radar.

### SA-6 Missiles

- According to Wikipedia, the SA-4A is the 9M8/9M8M and the SA-4B is the 9M8M1/9M8M2. Puma assigns A/B to these latter two. I'm going to assume the 9M8 is similar to the 9M8M1

## SA-7

- From AS and TSOH

### SA-7 Launch Units

- Section and squad
- VPs for section from AS

## SA-8

### SA-8 Launcher

- AS has it, but it appears to be a single vehicle. It can only take 1D damage and only has 6 ready missiles.
- Puma has a defense strength of 4H, which seems optimistic. I am using the AS value of 3H.

## SA-9

### SA-9 Launcher

- AS has it. Again, from its 4 ready missiles it seems to be a single vehicle.
- Data from Puma.
- Wikipedia says one on four has RWR.

## SA-11

In AS

### SA-11 Launcher

- AS has 4 ready missiles, so it seems to be a single vehicle. It does not have an EWR. However, the rules allow a SAM unit to lock-on with just its TTR (although an EWR gives a beneficial modifier).
- Puma gives 4 ready missiles, but also gives an EWR.
- Wikipedia states that a battery is two TELAR (four missiles each) and one TEL (6 missiles) and that a battalion has a command vehicle, and EWR, and three batteries.
- Wikipedia states that the 9K37 uses the 9S18 (Tube Arm) or 9S18M1 (Snow Drift) EWR.

### SA-11 Missiles

- Puma has slightly different flight properties for the CW and OP versions. I have adopted the CW version.

## SA-13

In AS

- Wikipedia has 1976

### SA-13 Launcher

### SA-13 Missiles

### I-Hawk

I-HAWK in AS

### I-HAWK Launcher

- AS and Puma both have this as three triple launchers, but a battery typically has six according to Wikipedia. However, Wikipedia also mentions an "AFCC" which controls one firing section of three launchers, one acquisition radar, and one illuminator. This matches the AS missile count.
-

### I-HAWK Missile

- MIM-23B
  - Puma has HOJ, but I think this was in the D.
- MIM-23C
  - Improved ECCM.
- MIM-23D
  - This (and the subsequent F/H/J/M) versions seem to be the HOJ versions.
  - I'm guessing the year. It was after 1982 and before 1990, looking at the diagram in the Wikipedia page.

## M48 Chaparral

In AS

### M48 Launcher

- Defense strength is 4H in AS and Puma. Giving it a hard defenses strength is extremely optimistic, as the carrier is open-topped and not armored.

### M48 Missiles

- MIM-71A
  - Based on AIM-9D
  - AS has speed 12 and Puma has speed 14. I adopt Puma's values.
  - Puma has the same hit rolls for OG as CW. I adopt the AS values.
- MIM-71C
  - Wikipedia: improved guidance, fuse, and warhead.
  - AS has speed 12 and Puma has speed 14 (for the E). I adopt Puma's values.
  - Since this doesn't seem to have a smokeless motor, give it the speed and visibility equal to the A.
- MIM-72E/F
  - Wikipedia: C with smokeless motor
  - Puma: Speed 16 rather than 12, but otherwise identical to C in AS.
  - Use Puma's speed and visibility.
- MIM-72G
  - Wikipedia: New seeker based on Stinger POST (FIM-92B) giving less susceptibility to IRCMs. Use E with flare and hit numbers from Puma's FIM-92B.

## Patriot

In AS

### Patriot Launcher
