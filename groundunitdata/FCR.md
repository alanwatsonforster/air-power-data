# FCR

## Add-On

- A = LF
- B = MF
- C = VF
- D = MW

VPs from Air Strike.

### Mobility

All seem to be towed.

### SCR-268

- Provided ranging and could direct a searchlight for night engagements (Wikipedia on M1 90 mm).
- Azimuth accuracy is about 1 degree (Wikipedia on SCR-268), which seems to match the idea of aiming a searchlight.

### SCR-584

- Using with M1 90 mm (Wikipedia on M1 90 mm)
- Used by British in WWII (Wikipedia on SCR-584)
- Soviet SON-9 (Fire Can), SON-30 (Fire Wheel), and SON-50 (Flap Wheel) are derivatives (Wikipedia on SCR-584)

- 4 RPM scan mode
- Automatic tracking mode
- Detect bombers at 40 miles

### SCR-784

Mobile version of SCR-584

### SON-4 (Whiff)

- Developed from SCR-584
- 1948
- <https://www.radartutorial.eu/19.kartei/11.ancient6/karte006.en.html>

### SON-9 (Fire Can)

- Used with 57, 85, 100, and 120 mm guns (Wikipedia).
- Based on SON-4 which in turn was based on the SCR-584 (Wikipedia).
- Used in Vietnam War (Wikipedia)
- No MTI
- <https://www.radartutorial.eu/19.kartei/11.ancient6/karte007.en.html>

- Appears to be FCR-A in TSOH

### SON-30 (Fire Wheel)

- Used with 130 mm guns (Wikipedia)

### SON-50 (Flap Wheel)

- Used with 57 mm guns (Wikipedia)
- Used in Vietnam War (Wikipedia)

### Super Fledermaus

- Used by Oerlikon 35 mm
- Combines tracking and search
  - Pulse Doppler Tracking is J band
  - Doppler Search is E/F band with a range of 15 km
- 1965 onwards
- Used in the first prototype of the Gepard
- Gepard FCR is VF = same frequency as FCR-C

- Original GT63 was replaced by Gt69 from 1970 to 1985 in Swiss service.
  - Adds background clutter suppression
  - Adds three optical target detectors

### Flycatcher

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flycatcher_(radar)>
- Used with Dutch Bofers L/70s
- Similar to the Cheetah radar, so presumably FCR-C

### Skyguard

- Used by Oerlikon 35 mm
- Pulse Doppler search and tracking
- Oerlikon 35 mm has FCR-D in scenario H-21/G-13 of Air Strike, and this is presumably Skyguard FCR

### Mark 7 (Blue Cedar)

- Has auto-follow
- 3 GHz = 10 cm
- Smaller than SCR-584 and GL Mk. III
- Similar concept to SCR-584, but more compact.
- British from 1952. Used with 5.25 in and QF 3.7 in guns
- Exported to Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and South Africa

## Integrated

### Gepard

- VF/W in Air Strike with a range of 10 hexes = 5.3 km
- Search radar is S band 15 km
- Tracking radar is Ku band 15 km
- Has IFF

### Cheetah

- Search radar is X band 15 km
- Tracking radar is X/Ka band 13 km

### Panhard M3 VDA

- ESD RA-20 Doppler radar with a range of 8 km
